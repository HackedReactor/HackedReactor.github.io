### A little bit about me:
I am from Brea, California and immigrated to the states when I was a wee lad. Some of my interests include basketball, technology, and outdoor activities.

I currently work at Sony Pictures in Cyber security, more specifically PAM (Privleged Access Management).

I did my undergrad at California State University-Fullerton with a degree in Business Administration | Concentration: MIS. Now I am currently pursuing my masters in Data Science from SMU.
